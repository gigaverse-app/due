# Coming from django-rq

django-rq gives RQ a Django configuration, worker and administration surface.
That makes the product model a natural place to begin Due adoption, but it does
not make RQ jobs and Due obligations interchangeable. Migrate one business
operation while keeping existing RQ workers and result consumers intact.

[All migration guides](../migrations.md) · [How Due fits](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/docs/alternatives.md)

Reviewed **2026-10-11** against Due `65e0bcf`; upstream versions and source
snapshots are recorded in the [source register](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/docs/alternatives.md#source-register).
This is a migration guide, not an implemented compatibility integration.

## What you gain, and what you keep

Due can commit a product change and its work together, then recover if the
broker wakeup is lost. A post-commit Redis enqueue alone has no durable memory
of a process dying before it runs. If your application already supplies an
outbox, the migration can replace that protocol rather than add another one.

Fenced local completion and provider-evidence modes are further benefits when
your current job maintains those mechanisms itself. Stay with django-rq when its
simple job API, Django admin integration and existing results are enough.
Due requires Celery and concrete work models; Redis may remain as the broker.

## Prepare the Due side

Due currently requires **Python 3.14+, Django >=6.0.8,<7, PostgreSQL, Celery,
a broker, workers and periodic recovery**. It is alpha; pin a reviewed GitHub
revision. Product, work and evidence must use the same writable database through
Django's default connection.

Choose the capability by the external contract: `ReplaySafeEffect` for safe
repetition, `Projection` for mutable external state, `ScheduledAction` for a
movable deadline, or `DurableExternalOperation` / `ObservedExternalOperation`
when a possibly applied request must wait for evidence. See the
[capability imports and examples](../capabilities.md); none makes an arbitrary
provider call safe to repeat.

1. Add `due.django` to `INSTALLED_APPS` and apply its migrations.
2. Define a product owner and concrete work model derived from
   `UniverseDurableWork`, with captured input fields and `durable_work_schema`.
   Apply your app's migration too.
3. Implement the external operation and its local completion separately. Register
   the capability in web, worker, Beat and management-command processes.
4. Include `due.django.runtime.tasks` in Celery imports, merge the generated
   recovery schedules, and run workers for the registered queue. Monitor overdue,
   stopped and UNKNOWN work, plus the recovery heartbeat.

The [integration reference](../integration.md) has the exact wiring. The
[document example](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/examples/documents/effects.py), its
[models](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/examples/documents/models.py) and
[registration](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/examples/documents/apps.py) form a complete implementation;
reuse that structure instead of inventing a queue wrapper. The `examples` package
belongs to this repository, not the installed Due runtime. In your application,
implement the corresponding producer and models in your own app.

## The interfaces you will work with

| Familiar primitive | Its strength | Due counterpart and semantic change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@job`, `.delay()`, `django_rq.enqueue()` | Django configuration around RQ functions and queues | Native capability/producer and a Due work registration |
| RQ `Job`, registries, Django admin | Job-level inspection and operational controls | Domain/work inspection; the old admin does not manage Due obligations |
| `get_queue("name")`, `RQ_QUEUES` | Named Redis connections and execution queues | Registration selects the Celery queue for a concrete work model |

## Before: the task and its caller

The comparison publishes document 42's text to an immutable object and records
its key in `Document.published_key`. The source example's application helper
`write_revision(text, publication_id)` writes the same bytes to a stable key on
retries and returns that key. `publication_id` is allocated once per request,
not on each retry. This helper is application code, not a library API; the Due
implementation below shows the actual file-write body.

These are focused integration excerpts: put definitions in importable app
modules, configure the source worker/backend, and provision the `Document` row.
The deliberately simple source task has no application-specific stale-write
fence. If yours already has one, preserve its contract and compare what code Due
would replace; the source library is not inherently unable to implement it.

```python
from django_rq import job
from .models import Document
from .storage import write_revision


@job("publication")
def publish(document_id: int, text: str, publication_id: str) -> str:
    key = write_revision(text, publication_id)
    Document.objects.filter(pk=document_id).update(published_key=key)
    return key


job = publish.delay(42, "Hello", "request-123")
# Later, after successful execution:
key = job.return_value()
```

The decorator and `.delay()` disappear for the selected operation. Keep the
application's useful storage function; move its ORM completion into
`finalize_success`. `RQ_QUEUES` cannot configure Due's Celery transport, and the
Django RQ admin still displays only RQ jobs.

The gain is that a lost post-commit wake-up no longer loses the only record of
owed publication: Due recovery scans the committed work row. Preserve existing
outbox/recovery guarantees if your current RQ integration already supplies them.

## After: model the obligation, split execution from completion

In your application's `models.py`, add a concrete work model. This example's
`OneToOneField` makes the document's **current publication** the obligation.
Use a distinct persisted request owner instead if every call must execute.
The fields below are from the [runnable models](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/examples/documents/models.py);
keep your existing `Document` model and migrate any added fields.

```python
from typing import ClassVar

from django.db import models

from due.django.models import UniverseDurableWork, durable_work_schema


class Document(models.Model):
    text = models.TextField(default="")
    publication_failed = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    published_key = models.CharField(max_length=64, blank=True)


class PublicationWork(UniverseDurableWork):
    work_owner_field: ClassVar[str] = "owner"
    owner = models.OneToOneField(Document, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
    text = models.TextField()

    class Meta:
        indexes, constraints = durable_work_schema("document_publication")
```

In `effects.py`, replace the decorated task with the following capability and
producer. This is the [runnable effect](https://github.com/gigaverse-app/due/blob/main/examples/documents/effects.py),
with its import changed to your application. The type parameters are owner,
captured work and effect result; here the provider returns a `str` key.

```python
import hashlib
import os
from pathlib import Path

from due.django.public import DurableWorkPolicy, DurableWorkState, ReplaySafeEffect
from .models import Document, PublicationWork


class PublishDocument(ReplaySafeEffect[Document, PublicationWork, str]):
    def perform_effect(self, work: PublicationWork) -> str:
        # Each revision writes its own immutable key. A late old worker cannot
        # overwrite the current revision's bytes. Retrying this key is safe.
        key = hashlib.sha256(work.provider_idempotency_key().encode()).hexdigest()
        output = Path(os.environ.get("DUE_OUTPUT_DIR", "/tmp/due-documents"))
        output.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
        (output / key).write_text(work.text)
        return key

    def finalize_success(self, work: PublicationWork, result: str) -> None:
        # Due holds the owner/work locks and validates the captured revision
        # and fencing token before publishing this pointer.
        Document.objects.filter(pk=work.owner_id).update(published_key=result, publication_failed=False)

    def finalize_retry(self, work: PublicationWork, error: Exception) -> None:
        if work.state == DurableWorkState.EXHAUSTED:
            Document.objects.filter(pk=work.owner_id).update(publication_failed=True)


publish_document = PublishDocument.for_owner(owner=Document, work=PublicationWork, policy=DurableWorkPolicy())


def request_publication(document_id: int, text: str) -> PublicationWork:
    """Commit product intent and its obligation together; wake only after commit."""
    with publish_document.atomic(document_id) as pending:
        document = pending.locked_owner
        document.text = text
        document.publication_failed = False
        document.save(update_fields=["text", "publication_failed"])
        return pending.request_work(PublicationWork(text=text, universe="example"))
```

The filesystem stands in for replay-safe object storage. For multiple worker
hosts use shared storage or your provider API with the same immutable-key
contract. A hash does not make an arbitrary payment/email/API request idempotent.
Do not generate a fresh provider key on each attempt.

The caller becomes:

```python
from .effects import request_publication
from .models import Document, PublicationWork

work = request_publication(42, "Hello")  # Admission; not completed publication.

# A later status read, not a blocking result/future API:
state = PublicationWork.objects.get(pk=work.pk).state
key = Document.objects.get(pk=42).published_key
```

`key` can still be the previous settled publication while newer work is pending.
The separate reads above are illustrative; expose a domain status endpoint with
consistent reads and revision identity if callers must correlate a particular
request. A work row can cover several revisions and is not a historical result
per submission. Apply the schema migration and registration described above
before sending work; defining the class alone does not start execution.

### What changed, and where the gain comes from

| Code change | Runtime meaning | Concrete gain or cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Function kwargs → `PublicationWork.text` | The captured input belongs to persisted work | The worker need not reread mutable document text to reconstruct what was owed |
| Enqueue call → `atomic()` plus `request_work()` | Product text and obligation commit or roll back together | Lost wake-up is recoverable from the database; upstream transactional enqueue may already provide atomicity |
| Storage call → `perform_effect()` | External work runs outside local settlement and may repeat | Reuses your provider code, but still requires a proven replay-safe contract |
| ORM update → `finalize_success()` | Due validates captured revision and ownership before publishing the pointer | An older attempt cannot publish over a newer local revision |
| Invocation result → product output and work state | Completion is a domain state transition | More explicit product semantics; callers lose a drop-in job-result API |

Try two edits: request text **A**, then **B**, and let A's worker finish last.
They write different immutable keys. Due rejects A's stale local settlement, so
it cannot replace B's product pointer. This does not kill A's provider request or
protect a mutable remote key. Requesting **B** again with unchanged input
preserves the obligation's outcome/budget; it is not another event and does not
restart stopped work. A deliberate recovery action uses `pending.retry_failed()`
where supported, rather than ordinary resubmission.

For a crash after storage succeeds but before local completion, this replay-safe
example may write the same revision again and then settle. It does **not** retain
a generic return-value checkpoint. If repetition is unsafe, choose an evidence-
backed operation instead; the operation must retain a correlated receipt and keep
an uncertain outcome `UNKNOWN` until resolved. That is a different capability,
not a retry flag on this example.

## Translate the contracts, not just the call

| Existing concept | Due migration decision |
| --- | --- |
| `django_rq.enqueue` / queue `.enqueue` / `@job` | One canonical Due producer used by every selected admission path |
| `RQ_QUEUES` and default timeout/result TTL | Explicit Due registration, worker limits and independent result retention |
| Commit-time enqueue behavior | Insert Due work inside the product transaction; defer only its notification |
| RQ Job, meta and result lookup | Persist the needed domain outcome or per-occurrence result; preserve old lookups |
| Exception handlers / callbacks | Retain reporting; move required effects to durable successors |
| Scheduled/deferred jobs and dependencies | Keep RQ ownership or explicitly model eligibility and handoff |
| RQ admin/worker commands | Operate both systems during cutover; Due does not replace their backend storage |

## Pay particular attention to

A wrapper around `django_rq.enqueue` catches only that entry point. A decorator,
management command, scheduled job or direct Queue call may still admit old work.
Map all paths to one authoritative producer for the chosen cohort.

Preserve custom `job_id`, serializer, result lifetime and dependency contracts.
Equal submissions to a one-row-per-document capability may coalesce; create a
request owner per occurrence when every RQ job must execute. For scheduled work,
convert local/naive timestamps deliberately to aware timestamps.

## Cutover and rollback

Deploy Due tables, registrations and workers/recovery first. Route new
occurrences of the selected operation to Due and drain old RQ queue entries,
started jobs, scheduled/deferred registries and retries. Keep django-rq admin
and old handlers for the remaining cohort; do not remove `RQ_QUEUES` globally.

Any import must quiesce the old execution/retry path, keep a unique mapping and
preserve provider keys and unknown outcomes. Rollback changes new admission
routing while Due finishes its existing work. Retire old result storage only
after all promised lookups expire or have an explicit replacement.

## Can a thin adapter help?

A facade for a few producer helpers can reduce source changes, but none ships.
It does not reproduce RQ Job, admin, decorators or custom queue classes. Reject
unsupported options before admission. Prefer an explicit application producer
when preserving a helper name would obscure the new transaction boundary.

Keep native capability access so the task can evolve into split execution and
settlement, or evidence-required operation. Otherwise only the wrapper's status
benefits from fencing, while the old task's writes remain outside it.

## Prove the migration before switching traffic

Bind [Due's application contracts](../conformance.md) to the actual new producer,
provider helper and completion path. Verify transaction/savepoint rollback,
lost post-commit notification, duplicate delivery, death after the external
call, stale completion after changed inputs, and visible retry exhaustion.
Observe the product result as well as the work row. Library tests alone cannot
prove provider idempotency or your application's completion condition. Include
two equal admissions with the intended occurrence/coalescing behavior, an
authorized retry of stopped work distinct from ordinary resubmission, and one
poisoned recovery identity that must not stall other work. If speed or operating
cost motivates the move, measure the real workload before and after; moving the
same effect to a different engine is not performance evidence.

Test every producer path, request transaction rollback, old admin/result URLs,
custom job IDs, dependency completion and retained exception reporting. During
rollback, prove that both producer versions cannot admit the same occurrence
under independent identities.
